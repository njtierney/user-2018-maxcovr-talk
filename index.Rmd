Has anyone connected to free public wifi in Brisbane?

The Brisbane government has a bunch of wifi routers around the place to prove free wifi for the people of Brisbane. This is awesome, when it works. I decided to take some steps to see how we could improve the location of wifi routers in Brisbane. It is going to take a bit of unpacking, so let me introduce the star players, The Data.

In short, imagine if you wanted to create a linear model in R, it is quite
straightforward - you fit the model, then you can get some predictions,
residuals, and so on.

With this optimisation model, there isnt any of that. It's a roll your own type
approach, and with that comes some danger. Well, danger through annoyance and
ignorance.

You get handed these vectors of answers, but you have no idea how these relate
abck to your problem. We don't have a good way to handle this kind of problem
that involves multiple data frames, so I needed to think about a new approach
for that.

And with that I think that there is this really important feature where the
information returned is a dataframe. - this follows on from recent discussion
over the years from people like Jenny Bryan stating the "vegas principle" - what
happens in a dataframe, stays in a dataframe.
